## Technical Task

### Booking Constraints
* The campsite can be reserved for max 3 days.
* The campsite can be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance.
* Reservations can be cancelled anytime.
* For sake of simplicity assume the check-in & check-out time is 12:00 AM.

### System Requirements
* The users will need to find out when the campsite is available. So the system should expose an API to provide information of the
availability of the campsite for a given date range with the default being 1 month.
* Provide an end point for reserving the campsite. The user will provide his/her email & full name at the time of reserving the campsite
along with intended arrival date and departure date. Return a unique booking identifier back to the caller if the reservation is successful.
* The unique booking identifier can be used to modify or cancel the reservation later on. Provide appropriate end point(s) to allow
modification/cancellation of an existing reservation.
* Due to the popularity of the campsite, there is a high likelihood of multiple users attempting to reserve the campsite for the same/overlapping
date(s). Demonstrate with appropriate test cases that the system can gracefully handle concurrent requests to reserve the campsite.
* Provide appropriate error messages to the caller to indicate the error cases.
* The system should be able to handle large volume of requests for getting the campsite availability.
* There are no restrictions on how reservations are stored as long as system constraints are not violated.

## Implementation Details

This project is implemented using an API-first(or contract-first) approach along with Maven's
multi-module project structure. You can read
more [here](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/) on the API-first
development approach.

## Tests

### Maven
* Run only unit tests:
```bash
$ mvn clean test
```
* Run only integration tests:
```bash
$ mvn clean failsafe:integration-test
```
* Run unit and integration tests:
```bash
$ mvn clean verify
```
* Run SonarCloud analysis, including test coverage, code smells, vulnerabilities, etc.:

```

### Swagger UI
The API can be tested via the Swagger UI:

![Swagger UI Main View](/readme/swagger-main-view.png)

For example, to add a new booking, expand the `POST` operation. Then click on the `Try it out`, add
the payload below to the `Request Body` text area, and click on the `Execute`:

```json
{
  "campsiteId": 1,
  "email": "John Smith",
  "fullName": "john.smith@email.com",
  "startDate": "2023-11-19",
  "endDate": "2023-11-21",
  "active": true
}
```
![Swagger UI Add Booking 1](/readme/swagger-add-booking-1.png)

If the operation is successful, you will get the following response:

![Swagger UI Add Booking 1](/readme/swagger-add-booking-2.png)

### Concurrent Tests

Start an instance of the Campsite Booking API via Docker Compose either
in [the in-memory-db](../container/docker-compose.yml) or
in [mysql](../container/campsite-booking-service-mysql/docker-compose.yml) profile.

```bash
$ docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### Bookings Creation

Execute the [concurrent-create-bookings.sh](../script/test/concurrent-create-bookings.sh) script to
simulate concurrent booking creation for the same booking dates:

```bash
$ ./script/test/concurrent-create-bookings.sh 2023-11-16 2023-11-17 http:/localhost:80
```
The response should be as follows after formatting, i.e., only one booking was created:
```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "4da1818c-2d9e-4efe-b59d-38915d6bc5d3",
    "version": 0,
    "campsiteId": 1,
    "email": "john.smith.2@email.com",
    "fullName": "John Smith 2",
    "startDate": "2023-11-16",
    "endDate": "2023-11-17",
    "active": true
  },
  {
    "status": 400,
    "message": "No vacant dates available from 2023-11-16 to 2023-11-17",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-12T20:31:23.751+00:00",
    "subErrors": []
  },
  {
    "status": 400,
    "message": "No vacant dates available from 2023-11-16 to 2023-11-17",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-12T20:31:23.756+00:00",
    "subErrors": []
  }
]
```

#### Booking Update

Execute the [concurrent-update-booking.sh](../script/test/concurrent-update-booking.sh) script to
simulate concurrent updates for the same booking:

```bash
$ ./script/test/concurrent-update-booking.sh 2023-11-15 2023-11-16 http:/localhost:80
```
The response should be as follows after formatting, i.e., only one booking was updated:
```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "ea10008b-c60e-41f9-97bb-313e9502e7f4",
    "version": 1,
    "campsiteId": 3,
    "email": "john.smith.1@email.com",
    "fullName": "John Smith 1",
    "startDate": "2023-11-15",
    "endDate": "2023-11-16",
    "active": true
  },
  {
    "status": 409,
    "message": "Optimistic locking error: com.kiroule.campsitebooking.repository.entity.BookingEntity with id 1 was updated by another transaction",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-12T20:29:55.008+00:00",
    "subErrors": []
  }
]
```

### Basic Load Testing 
Basic load testing for retrieving vacant dates can be performed with the ApacheBench by executing the following command:
```Bash
$ docker-compose.yml up -d
$ ab -n 10000 -c 100 -k http://localhost:80/api/v2/booking/vacant-dates
```
* **-n 10000** is the number of requests to make
* **-c 100** is the number of concurrent requests to make at a time
* **-k** sends the **KeepAlive** header, which asks the web server to not shut down the connection after each request is done, but to instead keep reusing it

Result:
```
