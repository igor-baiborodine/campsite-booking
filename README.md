A REST API service that manages campsite bookings. 

### Technical Task
#### Booking Constraints
* The campsite can be reserved for max 3 days.
* The campsite can be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance.
* Reservations can be cancelled anytime.
* For sake of simplicity assume the check-in & check-out time is 12:00 AM.
#### System Requirements
* The users will need to find out when the campsite is available. So the system should expose an API to provide information of the
availability of the campsite for a given date range with the default being 1 month.
* Provide an end point for reserving the campsite. The user will provide his/her email & full name at the time of reserving the campsite
along with intended arrival date and departure date. Return a unique booking identifier back to the caller if the reservation is successful.
* The unique booking identifier can be used to modify or cancel the reservation later on. Provide appropriate end point(s) to allow
modification/cancellation of an existing reservation
* Due to the popularity of the campsite, there is a high likelihood of multiple users attempting to reserve the campsite for the same/overlapping
date(s). Demonstrate with appropriate test cases that the system can gracefully handle concurrent requests to reserve the campsite.
* Provide appropriate error messages to the caller to indicate the error cases.
* The system should be able to handle large volume of requests for getting the campsite availability.
* There are no restrictions on how reservations are stored as as long as system constraints are not violated.
